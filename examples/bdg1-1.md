# Example Building 1-1

Example Building 1 is a simplistic, reference tiny office building consisting of a single story with 5 rooms spanning 5 space types.

This reference building was developed for and first described in the journal article ["Metadata Schemas and Ontologies for Building Energy Applications: A Critical Review and Use Case Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14072024).

This example Building 1-1 model is provided by current and former NIST staff and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
