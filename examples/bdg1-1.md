# Example Building 1 model 1

Example Building 1 is a simplistic, reference tiny office building consisting of a single story with 5 rooms spanning 5 space types.

This reference building was developed for and first described in the journal article ["Metadata Schemas and Ontologies for Building Energy Applications: A Critical Review and Use Case Analysis"](https://doi.org/10.3390/en14072024).

This example Building 1 model 1 is provided by current and former NIST staff and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. See also [Building 1 model 2](../bdg1-2.md) for a different modeling approach for the same building.
