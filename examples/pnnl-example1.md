# PNNL Example Building 1

This is an example building model provided by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
The building is simplistic, consisting of a single story with 5 rooms (open office, private office, bathroom, kitchenette, corridor).
The model was created using an alpha version of the PNNL Revit2RDF tool that creates a semantic model from a Revit building information model (BIM) exported via a Speckle (https://speckle.systems/) interface.
A Beta version of the Revit2RDF tool will tentatively be released via GitHub sometime in 2024.
The model contains a representation of the building architecture and electrical system.
