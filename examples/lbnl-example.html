<h2>Load and Validate Model<a class="headerlink" href="#load-and-validate-model" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>This code uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NREL/BuildingMOTIF">BuildingMOTIF</a> library to load the 223P ontology and the model file into a temporary in-memory instance.
It then validates the model against the ontology. If the model is invalid, it will print the validation report.</p>
<p>To run this code, you need to have Java installed on your system. If you do not have Java installed, you can remove the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shacl_engine='topquadrant'</span></code> parameter from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BuildingMOTIF</span></code> constructor.
Be warned that without the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shacl_engine='topquadrant'</span></code> parameter, the validation process will be slower.</p>
<div class="dropdown admonition note">
